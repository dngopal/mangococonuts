Empowering Support for BIPOC/POC individuals through detection of postpartum depression

This is the foundations for our AI Chatbot to help new mothers understand their test results for postpartum depression. Using one of the most advanced off-the-shelf frameworks, Llama, we were able to build a comprehensive first-line tool for stressed parents to understand the screening tool results. Science, color-changes, and understanding a new screening tool can be confusing: that's why we built this to DE-MYSTIFY the process.
