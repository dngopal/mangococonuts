Empowering Support for BIPOC/POC individuals through screening postpartum depression risk!

This is the foundations for our AI Chatbot to help new mothers understand their test results for postpartum depression. Using one of the most advanced off-the-shelf frameworks, Llama, we were able to build a comprehensive first-line tool for stressed parents to understand the screening tool results. Science, color-changes, and understanding a new screening tool can be confusing: that's why we built this to DE-MYSTIFY the process.

Every test will come with a QR code to our free chatbot. Let's help democraticize postpartum depression screening!

Team Name: Mango Coconuts

Project: Materna Metrix

Challenge: Dillard HEAL Program (Maternal Equity)

Code is functional with slight modification for user's API key + computer. This is not built on a website, simply due to time in a hackathon setting. Next steps include building a more robust, custom AI LLM Chatbot and plugging it into our official website.
